# Initiative Tracker
This is a tool that helps game masters keep track of combat turns in tabletop RPGs. It was built with D&D 5E in mind, but it can likely be used with other systems as well.

## What can it do?
At the moment, it really just keeps track of initiative values, player names, and armor classes.
Soon it will be able to open a separate window for players to view. GMs can hide certain values on this second window and put it on a monitor that the players can see.

Thanks for checking it out.

## Contributing
I'm not really comfortable with other contributions at the moment. I'd like to finish what I have planned for this app first.
